                    <p>A rocket (from Italian: rocchetto, lit. 'bobbin/spool') is a projectile, spacecraft, aircraft
                    or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely
                    from propellant carried within the rocket. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets
                    forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore
                    work in the vacuum of space.</p>

                    <p>In fact, rockets work more efficiently in space than in an atmosphere. Multistage rockets are 
                    capable of attaining escape velocity from Earth and therefore can achieve unlimited maximum altitude.
                    Compared with airbreathing engines, rockets are lightweight and powerful and capable of generating
                    large accelerations. To control their flight, rockets rely on momentum, airfoils, auxiliary reaction
                    engines, gimballed thrust, momentum wheels, deflection of the exhaust stream, propellant flow, spin,
                    or gravity.</p>

                    <p>A propellant tank is a container which is part of a vehicle, 
                    where propellant is stored prior to use. Propellant tanks vary in construction, and may be a fuel
                    tank in the case of many aircraft. In rocket vehicles, propellant tanks are fairly sophisticated
                    since weight is on a premium.</p>

                    <p>Rocket propellant tanks are pressure vessels where liquid fuels are stored prior to use. 
                    They have to store the propellant, while minimizing slosh and particularly when the tank is nearly 
                    empty, minimizing vortexing.</p>

                    <p>Rocket propellant tanks are often constructed of materials such as aluminium alloys, steels or
                    carbon fibre wound tanks. These kinds of tanks are usually constructed using monocoque construction
                    techniques. Balloon tanks are the most extreme of these, they are held rigid only by internal
                    pressurisation, but are extremely lightweight. Rocket propellant tanks are of many shapes but the
                    optimum shape of a tank is spherical, because for given volume it results in a tank with least weight.
                    Normally, propellant in the tank is stored at a pressure of about 1-4 bar, if the system uses
                    turbopump to deliver high pressure to the combustion chamber. This method reduces the wall thickness
                    and hence the weight of the tank. If the propellant in the tank is stored at very high pressure, 
                    then the wall thickness of the tank is increased and hence the weight of the tank.</p>

                    <p>A rocket engine uses stored rocket propellants as the reaction mass 
                    for forming a high-speed propulsive jet of fluid, usually high-temperature gas. Rocket engines are
                    reaction engines, producing thrust by ejecting mass rearward, in accordance with Newton's third law.
                    Most rocket engines use the combustion of reactive chemicals to supply the necessary energy, but 
                    non-combusting forms such as cold gas thrusters and nuclear thermal rockets also exist. 
                    Vehicles propelled by rocket engines are commonly called rockets. Rocket vehicles carry their own
                    oxidizer, unlike most combustion engines, so rocket engines can be used in a vacuum to propel 
                    spacecraft and ballistic missiles.</p>
                    
                    <p>Compared to other types of jet engines, rocket engines are the lightest and have the highest 
                    thrust, but are the least propellant-efficient (they have the lowest specific impulse). The
                    ideal exhaust is hydrogen, the lightest of all elements, but chemical rockets produce a mix of
                    heavier species, reducing the exhaust velocity.</p>

                    <p>A multistage rocket, or step rocket, is a launch vehicle that uses two or more rocket stages, 
                    each of which contains its own engines and propellant. A tandem or serial stage is mounted on top 
                    of another stage; a parallel stage is attached alongside another stage. The result is effectively 
                    two or more rockets stacked on top of or attached next to each other. Two-stage rockets are quite
                    common, but rockets with as many as five separate stages have been successfully launched.</p>
                    
                    <p>By jettisoning stages when they run out of propellant, the mass of the remaining rocket is 
                    decreased. Each successive stage can also be optimized for its specific operating conditions, such
                    as decreased atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes. This staging allows the thrust of the 
                    remaining stages to more easily accelerate the rocket to its final speed and height.</p>
